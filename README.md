# GablingMarlow

**My summer project:** I want to make a game prototype.</br>
I will use libraries where needed but I want to do most rendering myself. This is a playground for me and I'm experimenting and trying new ways of structuring the code than I normally do.</br>

</br>

**Prototype Game [GablingMarlow]:** I want a puzzle solving aspect. Thinking of having 3rd person view and controls. I want the player to experiance a sense of wonder and mystery when playing the finished game.
